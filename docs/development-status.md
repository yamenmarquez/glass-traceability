## Key Implementation Details for Future Development

### DimensionInput Component Logic
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Supports multiple input formats for user convenience
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on input correctness
- **Fraction Conversion**: Seamless conversion between decimals and fractions
- **Mobile Optimization**: Large touch targets and appropriate input types

### Authentication Flow
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains login state across browser sessions
- **Role Hierarchy**: Viewer (1) < Operator (2) < Admin (3) for permission checking
- **Profile Loading**: Automatic profile fetching with user session
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for auth failures

### Database Patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before database confirmation for better UX
- **Relational Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships maintained
- **Audit Trails**: Status changes tracked for compliance
- **Soft Deletes**: Items marked inactive rather than deleted

### PWA Features
- **Offline Support**: Service worker caches essential resources
- **App Installation**: Users can install as native app on mobile devices
- **Push Notifications**: Infrastructure ready for future notification features
